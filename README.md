# ClassroomClarity
This project aims to provide portable support for teachers through a central hub that displays student questions submitted through an app while also providing visual queues to inform on student engagement. Our goal is to improve lecutre quality for both the students and the teachers by also including a tactile queue for the professor to notify a question as been asked.
