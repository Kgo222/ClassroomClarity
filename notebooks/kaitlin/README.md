## 2/17/2025: App Design
Features we want to include in the app design:
- scaled rating where students can input what level of understanding they have of the current topic
- A way to submit text questions (anonymously and non-anonymously)
- A way for students to indicate they are raising their hand for a question
- A password students must input to be accepted to hub connection
- Bluetooth connect to hub
- Teacher side of app that allows them to choose hub settings
### Implementation ideas
1)  submit text questions (anonymously and non-anonymously)
   - Have a drop down where they can choose anonymous or non-anonymous
2) Teacher side:
  - when first enter app, have a screen to select "sign in as student" or "sign in as teacher"
  - "sign in as student" will ask them to input name and then password to the hub they select
  - "sign in as teacher" will ask them to input a password for teacher specifically
  - Features on hub teacher could change: font size, allow anonymous questions or not
### Visual Aid of Student Only App - didn't add Teacher side yet

## 2/12/2025 Team Meeting
- Worked on proposal and team contract
- Discussed the basic plan for division of work and areas people feel most comfortable executing 
### To Do
1. Pick OLED screen --> will determine if need another voltage regulator + battery size
2. Team Contract

What we did in the meeting: 
1. Divided up tasks
2. Finalized Component Choice + got links for any we need to order
4. Got rough estimate of minimum budget

For next meeting:
1. Jesse →  control & physical casing, Look into what programmer we need for the microcontroller
2. Kait → App and coding + Work on Schedule for Design Document
3, Maddie → Power and PCB (Idea for power PCB design)
