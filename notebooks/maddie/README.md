## 3/4/2025: Team meeting 
Discussed how the physical deisign of the hub casing should look. 
-Wanted to prioritize flexibility in user placement of the hub while also keeping portability in mind
- Presented the idea of using an ipad case as a basis for the design
    - gives ability to change angle of the screen
    - allows to fold into a less intrusive size for transport
- Discussed how we should handle the vibration motor
    - wanted to keep seperate from main hub to avoid vibrating the PCB
    - need to design a seperate casing for the motor itself
    - need to figure out how to fit the motor and casing into the hub for transport
